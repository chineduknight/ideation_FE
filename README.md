## About The App

WavyPay is an app that provides a simple authentication system allowing users to register and log in. It features client-side form validation to ensure correct input formats and uses Redux to manage application state.

## Screenshots

- Quite Simple so no screenshots needed

## Technologies

I used `React`, `Redux`, `Chakra UI`, `localforage`, `react-toastify`, `TypeScript`.

## Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- Navigate to the project directory
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the development server

## Approach

I adopted a modular approach with reusable components and used Chakra UI for consistent styling. Form validation is handled client-side with appropriate error messages for invalid inputs. State management is implemented using Redux to manage user authentication states.

## Status

WavyPay is still in progress. `Version 2` will be out soon.
